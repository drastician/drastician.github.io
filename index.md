# Richard Naples

I’m a data-focused professional with over 25 years of experience working in museum and library environments. My work sits at the intersection of data, research, and public service.

I’m especially interested in:
- Data analysis and visualization
- Metadata, bibliometrics, and linked data
- Thoughtful uses of AI in cultural heritage and information work
- Building small, useful tools with Python and the web

## Current interests

Right now I’m:
- Exploring how AI can support research and discovery in large collections
-
